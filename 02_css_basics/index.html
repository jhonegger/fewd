<p>Hi, I'm Ferg! I'm a West Highland white "terrierist" who likes long, fast-paced walks and chasing squirrels. "Squirrels?!" I <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">hate</span> those things! Click through my <a href="photos.html">fuzzy photos</a> to see how cute I am and why &ndash; no matter how naughty I can be &ndash; Mom will always think I'm too cute to strangle! Oh, and I should mention that I have a sister, Maisy. She likes to beat me up and acts as if I didn't exist most days. But deep down inside, I know that she thinks of me as her buddy. You'll see some photos of her, too.</p>
<h5>That's me in my business attire. What do you think of my Scottish tie?</h5>
